        "1:1 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the\nson of Abraham.\n\n1:2 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas\nand his brethren; 1:3 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and\nPhares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; 1:4 And Aram begat Aminadab;\nand Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; 1:5 And Salmon\nbegat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat\nJesse; 1:6 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat\nSolomon of her that had been the wife of Urias; 1:7 And Solomon begat\nRoboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; 1:8 And Asa begat\nJosaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; 1:9 And\nOzias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;\n1:10 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon\nbegat Josias; 1:11 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about\nthe time they were carried away to Babylon: 1:12 And after they were\nbrought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat\nZorobabel; 1:13 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim;\nand Eliakim begat Azor; 1:14 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat\nAchim; and Achim begat Eliud; 1:15 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and\nEleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; 1:16 And Jacob begat\nJoseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called\nChrist.\n\n1:17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen\ngenerations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are\nfourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto\nChrist are fourteen generations.\n\n1:18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his\nmother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was\nfound with child of the Holy Ghost.\n\n1:19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to\nmake her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.\n\n1:20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the\nLORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David,\nfear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived\nin her is of the Holy Ghost.\n\n1:21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name\nJESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.\n\n1:22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was\nspoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, 1:23 Behold, a virgin shall\nbe with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his\nname Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.\n\n1:24 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord\nhad bidden him, and took unto him his wife: 1:25 And knew her not till\nshe had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "2:1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of\nHerod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to\nJerusalem, 2:2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for\nwe have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.\n\n2:3 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and\nall Jerusalem with him.\n\n2:4 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the\npeople together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.\n\n2:5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is\nwritten by the prophet, 2:6 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda,\nart not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall\ncome a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.\n\n2:7 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of\nthem diligently what time the star appeared.\n\n2:8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently\nfor the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again,\nthat I may come and worship him also.\n\n2:9 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star,\nwhich they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood\nover where the young child was.\n\n2:10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.\n\n2:11 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child\nwith Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they\nhad opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and\nfrankincense and myrrh.\n\n2:12 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to\nHerod, they departed into their own country another way.\n\n2:13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord\nappeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young\nchild and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I\nbring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.\n\n2:14 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night,\nand departed into Egypt: 2:15 And was there until the death of Herod:\nthat it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the\nprophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.\n\n2:16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was\nexceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were\nin Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and\nunder, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the\nwise men.\n\n2:17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,\nsaying, 2:18 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and\nweeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and\nwould not be comforted, because they are not.\n\n2:19 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth\nin a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 2:20 Saying, Arise, and take the young\nchild and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are\ndead which sought the young child's life.\n\n2:21 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came\ninto the land of Israel.\n\n2:22 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room\nof his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding,\nbeing warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of\nGalilee: 2:23 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it\nmight be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be\ncalled a Nazarene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "3:1 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness\nof Judaea, 3:2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at\nhand.\n\n3:3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying,\nThe voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the\nLord, make his paths straight.\n\n3:4 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern\ngirdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.\n\n3:5 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region\nround about Jordan, 3:6 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing\ntheir sins.\n\n3:7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his\nbaptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned\nyou to flee from the wrath to come?  3:8 Bring forth therefore fruits\nmeet for repentance: 3:9 And think not to say within yourselves, We\nhave Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of\nthese stones to raise up children unto Abraham.\n\n3:10 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:\ntherefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,\nand cast into the fire.\n\n3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that\ncometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to\nbear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: 3:12\nWhose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and\ngather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with\nunquenchable fire.\n\n3:13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be\nbaptized of him.\n\n3:14 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee,\nand comest thou to me?  3:15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer\nit to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.\nThen he suffered him.\n\n3:16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the\nwater: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the\nSpirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: 3:17 And\nlo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am\nwell pleased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\n\n6:17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy\nface; 6:18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father\nwhich is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall\nreward thee openly.\n\n6:19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and\nrust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: 6:20 But\nlay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust\ndoth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: 6:21\nFor where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\n\n6:22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be\nsingle, thy whole body shall be full of light.\n\n6:23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of\ndarkness.\n\nIf therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that\ndarkness!  6:24 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate\nthe one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and\ndespise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\n\n6:25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye\nshall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye\nshall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than\nraiment?  6:26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither\ndo they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth\nthem. Are ye not much better than they?  6:27 Which of you by taking\nthought can add one cubit unto his stature?  6:28 And why take ye\nthought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow;\nthey toil not, neither do they spin: 6:29 And yet I say unto you, That\neven Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\n\n6:30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day\nis, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe\nyou, O ye of little faith?  6:31 Therefore take no thought, saying,\nWhat shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we\nbe clothed?  6:32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:)\nfor your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these\nthings.\n\n6:33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and\nall these things shall be added unto you.\n\n6:34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall\ntake thought for the things of itself.

This is he which received seed by the way side.\n\n13:20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he\nthat heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 13:21 Yet hath\nhe not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation\nor persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.\n\n13:22 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth\nthe word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches,\nchoke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.\n\n13:23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that\nheareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and\nbringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.\n\n13:24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of\nheaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 13:25\nBut while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat,\nand went his way.\n\n13:26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then\nappeared the tares also.\n\n13:27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir,\ndidst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it\ntares?  13:28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants\nsaid unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?  13:29\nBut he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also\nthe wheat with them.\n\n13:30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of\nharvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares,\nand bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my\nbarn.\n\n13:31 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of\nheaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed\nin his field: 13:32 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when\nit is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so\nthat the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.\n\n13:33 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is\nlike unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of\nmeal, till the whole was leavened.\n\n13:34 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and\nwithout a parable spake he not unto them: 13:35 That it might be\nfulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my\nmouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret\nfrom the foundation of the world.\n\n13:36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and\nhis disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of\nthe tares of the field.\n\n13:37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is\nthe Son of man; 13:38 The field is the world; the good seed are the\nchildren of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked\none; 13:39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the\nend of the world; and the reapers are the angels.\n\n13:40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so\nshall it be in the end of this world.\n\n13:41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall\ngather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do\niniquity; 13:42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there\nshall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\n\n13:43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom\nof their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n13:44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a\nfield; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof\ngoeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.\n\n13:45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,\nseeking goodly pearls: 13:46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great\nprice, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.\n\n13:47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast\ninto the sea, and gathered of every kind: 13:48 Which, when it was\nfull, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into\nvessels, but cast the bad away.\n\n13:49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come\nforth, and sever the wicked from among the just, 13:50 And shall cast\nthem into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of\nteeth.\n\n13:51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They\nsay unto him, Yea, Lord.\n\n13:52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is\ninstructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an\nhouseholder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and\nold.\n\n13:53 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these\nparables, he departed thence.\n\n13:54 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in\ntheir synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence\nhath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?  13:55 Is not this\nthe carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren,\nJames, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?  13:56 And his sisters, are\nthey not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?\n13:57 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A\nprophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own\nhouse.\n\n13:58 And he did not many mighty works there because of their\nunbelief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And if the\nblind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.\n\n15:15 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this\nparable.\n\n15:16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?  15:17 Do\nnot ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth\ninto the belly, and is cast out into the draught?  15:18 But those\nthings which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and\nthey defile the man.\n\n15:19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,\nfornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 15:20 These are the\nthings which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not\na man.\n\n15:21 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and\nSidon.\n\n15:22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and\ncried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David;\nmy daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.\n\n15:23 But he answered her not a word.

        "27:1 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of\nthe people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: 27:2 And\nwhen they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to\nPontius Pilate the governor.\n\n27:3 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was\ncondemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of\nsilver to the chief priests and elders, 27:4 Saying, I have sinned in\nthat I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that\nto us? see thou to that.\n\n27:5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and\ndeparted, and went and hanged himself.\n\n27:6 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not\nlawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of\nblood.\n\n27:7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field,\nto bury strangers in.\n\n27:8 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this\nday.\n\n27:9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,\nsaying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him\nthat was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; 27:10\nAnd gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.\n\n27:11 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him,\nsaying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou\nsayest.\n\n27:12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he\nanswered nothing.\n\n27:13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they\nwitness against thee?  27:14 And he answered him to never a word;\ninsomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.\n\n27:15 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the\npeople a prisoner, whom they would.\n\n27:16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.\n\n27:17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto\nthem, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which\nis called Christ?  27:18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered\nhim.\n\n27:19 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto\nhim, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have\nsuffered many things this day in a dream because of him.\n\n27:20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that\nthey should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.\n\n27:21 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain\nwill ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.\n\n27:22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is\ncalled Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.\n\n27:23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they\ncried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.\n\n27:24 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a\ntumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the\nmultitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see\nye to it.\n\n27:25 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and\non our children.\n\n27:26 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged\nJesus, he delivered him to be crucified.\n\n27:27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common\nhall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.\n\n27:28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.\n\n27:29 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon\nhis head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before\nhim, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!  27:30 And they\nspit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.\n\n27:31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from\nhim, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.\n\n27:32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name:\nhim they compelled to bear his cross.\n\n27:33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to\nsay, a place of a skull, 27:34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled\nwith gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.\n\n27:35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:\nthat it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They\nparted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.\n\n27:36 And sitting down they watched him there; 27:37 And set up over\nhis head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.\n\n27:38 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right\nhand, and another on the left.\n\n27:39 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, 27:40\nAnd saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three\ndays, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the\ncross.\n\n27:41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes\nand elders, said, 27:42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he\nbe the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we\nwill believe him.\n\n27:43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him:\nfor he said, I am the Son of God.\n\n27:44 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same\nin his teeth.\n\n27:45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land\nunto the ninth hour.\n\n27:46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,\nEli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast\nthou forsaken me?  27:47 Some of them that stood there, when they\nheard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.\n\n27:48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled\nit with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.\n\n27:49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to\nsave him.\n\n27:50 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the\nghost.\n\n27:51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the\ntop to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; 27:52\nAnd the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept\narose, 27:53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and\nwent into the holy city, and appeared unto many.\n\n27:54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching\nJesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they\nfeared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.\n\n27:55 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed\nJesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: 27:56 Among which was Mary\nMagdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of\nZebedees children.\n\n27:57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,\nnamed Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple: 27:58 He went to\nPilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body\nto be delivered.\n\n27:59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean\nlinen cloth, 27:60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn\nout in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the\nsepulchre, and departed.\n\n27:61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over\nagainst the sepulchre.\n\n27:62 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the\nchief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, 27:63 Saying,\nSir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive,\nAfter three days I will rise again.\n\n27:64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the\nthird day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and\nsay unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error\nshall be worse than the first.\n\n27:65 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as\nsure as ye can.\n\n27:66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone,\nand setting a watch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "28:1 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first\nday of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the\nsepulchre.\n\n28:2 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the\nLord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from\nthe door, and sat upon it.\n\n28:3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as\nsnow: 28:4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as\ndead men.\n\n28:5 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for\nI know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.\n\n28:6 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place\nwhere the Lord lay.\n\n28:7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the\ndead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye\nsee him: lo, I have told you.\n\n28:8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great\njoy; and did run to bring his disciples word.\n\n28:9 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them,\nsaying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and\nworshipped him.\n\n28:10 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren\nthat they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.\n\n28:11 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into\nthe city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were\ndone.\n\n28:12 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken\ncounsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, 28:13 Saying, Say\nye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.\n\n28:14 And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him,\nand secure you.\n\n28:15 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this\nsaying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.\n\n28:16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a\nmountain where Jesus had appointed them.\n\n28:17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.\n\n28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given\nunto me in heaven and in earth.\n\n28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the\nname of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 28:20\nTeaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you:\nand, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.

I know thee\nwho thou art, the Holy One of God.\n\n1:25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of\nhim.\n\n1:26 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud\nvoice, he came out of him.\n\n1:27 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among\nthemselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for\nwith authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do\nobey him.\n\n1:28 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region\nround about Galilee.\n\n1:29 And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they\nentered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.\n\n1:30 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell\nhim of her.\n\n1:31 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and\nimmediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.\n\n1:32 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that\nwere diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.\n\n1:33 And all the city was gathered together at the door.\n\n1:34 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast\nout many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they\nknew him.\n\n1:35 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went\nout, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.\n\n1:36 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.\n\n1:37 And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for\nthee.\n\n1:38 And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may\npreach there also: for therefore came I forth.\n\n1:39 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and\ncast out devils.\n\n1:40 And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down\nto him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.\n\n1:41 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched\nhim, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.\n\n1:42 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed\nfrom him, and he was cleansed.\n\n1:43 And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 1:44\nAnd saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way,\nshew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things\nwhich Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.\n\n1:45 But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze\nabroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into\nthe city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from\nevery quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And they\nmarvelled at him.\n\n12:18 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no\nresurrection; and they asked him, saying, 12:19 Master, Moses wrote\nunto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and\nleave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up\nseed unto his brother.\n\n12:20 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and\ndying left no seed.\n\n12:21 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and\nthe third likewise.\n\n12:22 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman\ndied also.\n\n12:23 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife\nshall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.\n\n12:24 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err,\nbecause ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?  12:25\nFor when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are\ngiven in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.\n\n12:26 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in\nthe book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am\nthe God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  12:27\nHe is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore\ndo greatly err.\n\n12:28 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning\ntogether, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him,\nWhich is the first commandment of all?  12:29 And Jesus answered him,\nThe first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God\nis one Lord: 12:30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy\nheart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy\nstrength: this is the first commandment.\n\n12:31 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy\nneighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than\nthese.\n\n12:32 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the\ntruth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he: 12:33 And\nto love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and\nwith all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his\nneighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and\nsacrifices.\n\n12:34 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto\nhim, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that\ndurst ask him any question.\n\n12:35 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How\nsay the scribes that Christ is the son of David?  12:36 For David\nhimself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on\nmy right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.\n\n12:37 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then\nhis son? And the common people heard him gladly.\n\n12:38 And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes,\nwhich love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the\nmarketplaces, 12:39 And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the\nuppermost rooms at feasts: 12:40 Which devour widows' houses, and for\na pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.\n\n12:41 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the\npeople cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in\nmuch.\n\n12:42 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites,\nwhich make a farthing.\n\n12:43 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,\nVerily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than\nall they which have cast into the treasury: 12:44 For all they did\ncast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that\nshe had, even all her living.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "13:1 And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto\nhim, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!\n13:2 And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great\nbuildings?  there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall\nnot be thrown down.\n\n13:3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple,\nPeter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, 13:4 Tell us,\nwhen shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these\nthings shall be fulfilled?  13:5 And Jesus answering them began to\nsay, Take heed lest any man deceive you: 13:6 For many shall come in\nmy name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.\n\n13:7 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not\ntroubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.\n\n13:8 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against\nkingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there\nshall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.\n\n13:9 But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to\ncouncils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be\nbrought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against\nthem.\n\n13:10 And the gospel must first be published among all nations.\n\n13:11 But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no\nthought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but\nwhatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is\nnot ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.\n\n13:12 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the\nfather the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and\nshall cause them to be put to death.\n\n13:13 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that\nshall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.\n\n13:14 But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of\nby Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that\nreadeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the\nmountains: 13:15 And let him that is on the housetop not go down into\nthe house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:\n13:16 And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take\nup his garment.\n\n13:17 But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck\nin those days!  13:18 And pray ye that your flight be not in the\nwinter.\n\n13:19 For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the\nbeginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither\nshall be.\n\n13:20 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh\nshould be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he\nhath shortened the days.\n\n13:21 And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or,\nlo, he is there; believe him not: 13:22 For false Christs and false\nprophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if\nit were possible, even the elect.\n\n13:23 But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.\n\n13:24 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be\ndarkened, and the moon shall not give her light, 13:25 And the stars\nof heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be\nshaken.\n\n13:26 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with\ngreat power and glory.\n\n13:27 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his\nelect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the\nuttermost part of heaven.\n\n13:28 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet\ntender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near: 13:29\nSo ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass,\nknow that it is nigh, even at the doors.\n\n13:30 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till\nall these things be done.\n\n13:31 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass\naway.\n\n13:32 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels\nwhich are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.\n\n13:33 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.\n\n13:34 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left\nhis house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his\nwork, and commanded the porter to watch.\n\n13:35 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house\ncometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the\nmorning: 13:36 Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.\n\n13:37 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "14:1 After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened\nbread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might\ntake him by craft, and put him to death.\n\n14:2 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of\nthe people.\n\n14:3 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat\nat meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of\nspikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his\nhead.\n\n14:4 And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and\nsaid, Why was this waste of the ointment made?  14:5 For it might have\nbeen sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to\nthe poor. And they murmured against her.\n\n14:6 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath\nwrought a good work on me.\n\n14:7 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye\nmay do them good: but me ye have not always.\n\n14:8 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my\nbody to the burying.\n\n14:9 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached\nthroughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be\nspoken of for a memorial of her.\n\n14:10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief\npriests, to betray him unto them.\n\n14:11 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him\nmoney. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.\n\n14:12 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the\npassover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and\nprepare that thou mayest eat the passover?  14:13 And he sendeth forth\ntwo of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and\nthere shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.\n\n14:14 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the\nhouse, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat\nthe passover with my disciples?  14:15 And he will shew you a large\nupper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.\n\n14:16 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found\nas he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.\n\n14:17 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.\n\n14:18 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you,\nOne of you which eateth with me shall betray me.\n\n14:19 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one,\nIs it I? and another said, Is it I?  14:20 And he answered and said\nunto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.\n\n14:21 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to\nthat man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man\nif he had never been born.\n\n14:22 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake\nit, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.\n\n14:23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to\nthem: and they all drank of it.\n\n14:24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,\nwhich is shed for many.\n\n14:25 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the\nvine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\n\n14:26 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of\nOlives.\n\n14:27 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of\nme this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the\nsheep shall be scattered.\n\n14:28 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.\n\n14:29 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet\nwill not I.\n\n14:30 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day,\neven in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me\nthrice.\n\n14:31 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I\nwill not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.\n\n14:32 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he\nsaith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.\n\n14:33 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be\nsore amazed, and to be very heavy; 14:34 And saith unto them, My soul\nis exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.\n\n14:35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed\nthat, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.\n\n14:36 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;\ntake away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what\nthou wilt.\n\n14:37 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter,\nSimon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?  14:38 Watch\nye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready,\nbut the flesh is weak.\n\n14:39 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.\n\n14:40 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their\neyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.\n\n14:41 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now,\nand take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of\nman is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\n\n14:42 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.\n\n14:43 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the\ntwelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from\nthe chief priests and the scribes and the elders.\n\n14:44 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying,\nWhomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away\nsafely.\n\n14:45 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and\nsaith, Master, master; and kissed him.\n\n14:46 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.\n\n14:47 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant\nof the high priest, and cut off his ear.\n\n14:48 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as\nagainst a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?  14:49 I was\ndaily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the\nscriptures must be fulfilled.\n\n14:50 And they all forsook him, and fled.\n\n14:51 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth\ncast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him: 14:52\nAnd he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.\n\n14:53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were\nassembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.\n\n14:54 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the\nhigh priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the\nfire.\n\n14:55 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness\nagainst Jesus to put him to death; and found none.\n\n14:56 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness\nagreed not together.\n\n14:57 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,\nsaying, 14:58 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is\nmade with hands, and within three days I will build another made\nwithout hands.\n\n14:59 But neither so did their witness agree together.\n\n14:60 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,\nsaying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against\nthee?  14:61 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the\nhigh priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son\nof the Blessed?  14:62 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son\nof man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of\nheaven.\n\n14:63 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we\nany further witnesses?  14:64 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think\nye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.\n\n14:65 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to\nbuffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike\nhim with the palms of their hands.\n\n14:66 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the\nmaids of the high priest: 14:67 And when she saw Peter warming\nhimself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus\nof Nazareth.\n\n14:68 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what\nthou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.\n\n14:69 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood\nby, This is one of them.\n\n14:70 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by\nsaid again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a\nGalilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.\n\n14:71 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man\nof whom ye speak.\n\n14:72 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the\nword that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt\ndeny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "15:1 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a\nconsultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and\nbound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.\n\n15:2 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he\nanswering said unto them, Thou sayest it.\n\n15:3 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered\nnothing.\n\n15:4 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?\nbehold how many things they witness against thee.\n\n15:5 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.\n\n15:6 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever\nthey desired.\n\n15:7 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that\nhad made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the\ninsurrection.\n\n15:8 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he\nhad ever done unto them.\n\n15:9 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you\nthe King of the Jews?  15:10 For he knew that the chief priests had\ndelivered him for envy.\n\n15:11 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather\nrelease Barabbas unto them.\n\n15:12 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then\nthat I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?  15:13 And\nthey cried out again, Crucify him.\n\n15:14 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And\nthey cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.\n\n15:15 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas\nunto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be\ncrucified.\n\n15:16 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium;\nand they call together the whole band.\n\n15:17 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns,\nand put it about his head, 15:18 And began to salute him, Hail, King\nof the Jews!  15:19 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and\ndid spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.\n\n15:20 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him,\nand put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.\n\n15:21 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out\nof the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.\n\n15:22 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being\ninterpreted, The place of a skull.\n\n15:23 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he\nreceived it not.\n\n15:24 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,\ncasting lots upon them, what every man should take.\n\n15:25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.\n\n15:26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE\nKING OF THE JEWS.\n\n15:27 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right\nhand, and the other on his left.\n\n15:28 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was\nnumbered with the transgressors.\n\n15:29 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and\nsaying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three\ndays, 15:30 Save thyself, and come down from the cross.\n\n15:31 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves\nwith the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.\n\n15:32 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that\nwe may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled\nhim.\n\n15:33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the\nwhole land until the ninth hour.\n\n15:34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,\nEloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my\nGod, why hast thou forsaken me?  15:35 And some of them that stood by,\nwhen they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.\n\n15:36 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a\nreed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether\nElias will come to take him down.\n\n15:37 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.\n\n15:38 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the\nbottom.\n\n15:39 And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that\nhe so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was\nthe Son of God.\n\n15:40 There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary\nMagdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and\nSalome; 15:41 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and\nministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto\nJerusalem.\n\n15:42 And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation,\nthat is, the day before the sabbath, 15:43 Joseph of Arimathaea, an\nhonourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came,\nand went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.\n\n15:44 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto\nhim the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.\n\n15:45 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to\nJoseph.\n\n15:46 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in\nthe linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock,\nand rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.\n\n15:47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he\nwas laid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "1:1 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a\ndeclaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,\n1:2 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were\neyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; 1:3 It seemed good to me\nalso, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very\nfirst, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, 1:4\nThat thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou\nhast been instructed.\n\n1:5 THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain\npriest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the\ndaughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.\n\n1:6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the\ncommandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.\n\n1:7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they\nboth were now well stricken in years.\n\n1:8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office\nbefore God in the order of his course, 1:9 According to the custom of\nthe priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the\ntemple of the Lord.\n\n1:10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the\ntime of incense.\n\n1:11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the\nright side of the altar of incense.\n\n1:12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon\nhim.\n\n1:13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer\nis heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt\ncall his name John.\n\n1:14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at\nhis birth.\n\n1:15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink\nneither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy\nGhost, even from his mother's womb.\n\n1:16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord\ntheir God.\n\n1:17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to\nturn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to\nthe wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\n\n1:18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for\nI am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.\n\n1:19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand\nin the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew\nthee these glad tidings.\n\n1:20 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the\nday that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not\nmy words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.\n\n1:21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he\ntarried so long in the temple.\n\n1:22 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they\nperceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned\nunto them, and remained speechless.\n\n1:23 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his\nministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.\n\n1:24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid\nherself five months, saying, 1:25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in\nthe days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.\n\n1:26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a\ncity of Galilee, named Nazareth, 1:27 To a virgin espoused to a man\nwhose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name\nwas Mary.\n\n1:28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art\nhighly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.\n\n1:29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in\nher mind what manner of salutation this should be.\n\n1:30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found\nfavour with God.\n\n1:31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a\nson, and shalt call his name JESUS.\n\n1:32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:\nand the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:\n1:33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his\nkingdom there shall be no end.\n\n1:34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know\nnot a man?  1:35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy\nGhost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall\novershadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of\nthee shall be called the Son of God.\n\n1:36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son\nin her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called\nbarren.\n\n1:37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.\n\n1:38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me\naccording to thy word. And the angel departed from her.\n\n1:39 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with\nhaste, into a city of Juda; 1:40 And entered into the house of\nZacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.\n\n1:41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of\nMary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the\nHoly Ghost: 1:42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said,\nBlessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.\n\n1:43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come\nto me?  1:44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded\nin mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.\n\n1:45 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a\nperformance of those things which were told her from the Lord.\n\n1:46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, 1:47 And my spirit\nhath rejoiced in God my Saviour.\n\n1:48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,\nbehold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.\n\n1:49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is\nhis name.\n\n1:50 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to\ngeneration.\n\n1:51 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud\nin the imagination of their hearts.\n\n1:52 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of\nlow degree.\n\n1:53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath\nsent empty away.\n\n1:54 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;\n1:55 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.\n\n1:56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her\nown house.\n\n1:57 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and\nshe brought forth a son.\n\n1:58 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed\ngreat mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.\n\n1:59 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to\ncircumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of\nhis father.\n\n1:60 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called\nJohn.\n\n1:61 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is\ncalled by this name.\n\n1:62 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.\n\n1:63 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is\nJohn. And they marvelled all.\n\n1:64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and\nhe spake, and praised God.\n\n1:65 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these\nsayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.\n\n1:66 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts,\nsaying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord\nwas with him.\n\n1:67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and\nprophesied, saying, 1:68 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he\nhath visited and redeemed his people, 1:69 And hath raised up an horn\nof salvation for us in the house of his servant David; 1:70 As he\nspake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the\nworld began: 1:71 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from\nthe hand of all that hate us; 1:72 To perform the mercy promised to\nour fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; 1:73 The oath which he\nsware to our father Abraham, 1:74 That he would grant unto us, that we\nbeing delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without\nfear, 1:75 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of\nour life.\n\n1:76 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for\nthou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; 1:77 To\ngive knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their\nsins, 1:78 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring\nfrom on high hath visited us, 1:79 To give light to them that sit in\ndarkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of\npeace.\n\n1:80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the\ndeserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "2:1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree\nfrom Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.\n\n2:2 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of\nSyria.)  2:3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.\n\n2:4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,\ninto Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem;\n(because he was of the house and lineage of David:) 2:5 To be taxed\nwith Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.\n\n2:6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were\naccomplished that she should be delivered.\n\n2:7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in\nswaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room\nfor them in the inn.\n\n2:8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,\nkeeping watch over their flock by night.\n\n2:9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of\nthe Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.\n\n2:10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you\ngood tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.\n\n2:11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,\nwhich is Christ the Lord.\n\n2:12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped\nin swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.\n\n2:13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly\nhost praising God, and saying, 2:14 Glory to God in the highest, and\non earth peace, good will toward men.\n\n2:15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into\nheaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto\nBethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord\nhath made known unto us.\n\n2:16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the\nbabe lying in a manger.\n\n2:17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying\nwhich was told them concerning this child.\n\n2:18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were\ntold them by the shepherds.\n\n2:19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.\n\n2:20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all\nthe things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.\n\n2:21 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the\nchild, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel\nbefore he was conceived in the womb.\n\n2:22 And when the days of her purification according to the law of\nMoses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him\nto the Lord;

2:32 A light to lighten the\nGentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.\n\n2:33 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were\nspoken of him.\n\n2:34 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold,\nthis child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and\nfor a sign which shall be spoken against; 2:35 (Yea, a sword shall\npierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts\nmay be revealed.\n\n2:36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of\nthe tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an\nhusband seven years from her virginity;

And immediately the leprosy departed from him.\n\n5:14 And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to\nthe priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded,\nfor a testimony unto them.\n\n5:15 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great\nmultitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their\ninfirmities.\n\n5:16 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.\n\n5:17 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that\nthere were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were\ncome out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the\npower of the Lord was present to heal them.\n\n5:18 And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a\npalsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before\nhim.\n\n5:19 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in\nbecause of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him\ndown through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.\n\n5:20 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are\nforgiven thee.\n\n5:21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is\nthis which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?\n5:22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto\nthem, What reason ye in your hearts?  5:23 Whether is easier, to say,\nThy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?  5:24 But that\nye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins,\n(he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take\nup thy couch, and go into thine house.\n\n5:25 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon\nhe lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.\n\n5:26 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled\nwith fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.\n\n5:27 And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named\nLevi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow\nme.\n\n5:28 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.\n\n5:29 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a\ngreat company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.\n\n5:30 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples,\nsaying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?  5:31 And\nJesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a\nphysician; but they that are sick.\n\n5:32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\n\n5:33 And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often,\nand make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but\nthine eat and drink?  5:34 And he said unto them, Can ye make the\nchildren of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?\n5:35 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away\nfrom them, and then shall they fast in those days.\n\n5:36 And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of\na new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a\nrent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the\nold.\n\n5:37 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine\nwill burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.\n\n5:38 But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are\npreserved.\n\n5:39 No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for\nhe saith, The old is better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "6:1 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he\nwent through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of\ncorn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.\n\n6:2 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which\nis not lawful to do on the sabbath days?  6:3 And Jesus answering them\nsaid, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself\nwas an hungred, and they which were with him; 6:4 How he went into the\nhouse of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to\nthem that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the\npriests alone?  6:5 And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord\nalso of the sabbath.\n\n6:6 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into\nthe synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was\nwithered.\n\n6:7 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal\non the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.\n\n6:8 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the\nwithered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and\nstood forth.\n\n6:9 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful\non the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to\ndestroy it?  6:10 And looking round about upon them all, he said unto\nthe man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was\nrestored whole as the other.\n\n6:11 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another\nwhat they might do to Jesus.\n\n6:12 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a\nmountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.\n\n6:13 And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of\nthem he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles; 6:14 Simon, (whom\nhe also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip\nand Bartholomew, 6:15 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus,\nand Simon called Zelotes, 6:16 And Judas the brother of James, and\nJudas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.\n\n6:17 And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the\ncompany of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all\nJudaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which\ncame to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; 6:18 And they\nthat were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.\n\n6:19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went\nvirtue out of him, and healed them all.\n\n6:20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be\nye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.\n\n6:21 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed\nare ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.\n\n6:22 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall\nseparate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out\nyour name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.\n\n6:23 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your\nreward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers\nunto the prophets.\n\n6:24 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your\nconsolation.\n\n6:25 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you\nthat laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.\n\n6:26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did\ntheir fathers to the false prophets.\n\n6:27 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them\nwhich hate you, 6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them\nwhich despitefully use you.\n\n6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the\nother; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat\nalso.\n\n6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh\naway thy goods ask them not again.\n\n6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them\nlikewise.\n\n6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for\nsinners also love those that love them.\n\n6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have\nye?  for sinners also do even the same.\n\n6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank\nhave ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.\n\n6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for\nnothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the\nchildren of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the\nevil.\n\n6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.\n\n6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall\nnot be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 6:38 Give, and it\nshall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken\ntogether, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with\nthe same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you\nagain.\n\n6:39 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind?\nshall they not both fall into the ditch?  6:40 The disciple is not\nabove his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his\nmaster.\n\n6:41 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but\nperceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?  6:42 Either how\ncanst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that\nis in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in\nthine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine\nown eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is\nin thy brother's eye.\n\n6:43 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a\ncorrupt tree bring forth good fruit.\n\n6:44 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do\nnot gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.\n\n6:45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth\nthat which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his\nheart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the\nheart his mouth speaketh.\n\n6:46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I\nsay?  6:47 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth\nthem, I will shew you to whom he is like: 6:48 He is like a man which\nbuilt an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock:\nand when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house,\nand could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.\n\n6:49 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a\nfoundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did\nbeat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house\nwas great.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "7:1 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the\npeople, he entered into Capernaum.\n\n7:2 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was\nsick, and ready to die.\n\n7:3 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the\nJews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.\n\n7:4 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying,\nThat he was worthy for whom he should do this: 7:5 For he loveth our\nnation, and he hath built us a synagogue.\n\n7:6 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the\nhouse, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord,\ntrouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter\nunder my roof: 7:7 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come\nunto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.\n\n7:8 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers,\nand I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he\ncometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.\n\n7:9 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him\nabout, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I\nhave not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.\n\n7:10 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the\nservant whole that had been sick.\n\n7:11 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city\ncalled Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.\n\n7:12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was\na dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a\nwidow: and much people of the city was with her.\n\n7:13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said\nunto her, Weep not.\n\n7:14 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood\nstill.\n\nAnd he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.\n\n7:15 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered\nhim to his mother.\n\n7:16 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying,\nThat a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited\nhis people.\n\n7:17 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and\nthroughout all the region round about.\n\n7:18 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.\n\n7:19 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to\nJesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?\n7:20 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath\nsent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we\nfor another?  7:21 And in that same hour he cured many of their\ninfirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were\nblind he gave sight.\n\n7:22 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John\nwhat things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame\nwalk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to\nthe poor the gospel is preached.\n\n7:23 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.\n\n7:24 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak\nunto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness\nfor to see?  A reed shaken with the wind?  7:25 But what went ye out\nfor to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?  Behold, they which are\ngorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.\n\n7:26 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you,\nand much more than a prophet.\n\n7:27 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger\nbefore thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.\n\n7:28 For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is\nnot a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in\nthe kingdom of God is greater than he.\n\n7:29 And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified\nGod, being baptized with the baptism of John.\n\n7:30 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against\nthemselves, being not baptized of him.\n\n7:31 And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this\ngeneration? and to what are they like?  7:32 They are like unto\nchildren sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and\nsaying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have\nmourned to you, and ye have not wept.\n\n7:33 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine;\nand ye say, He hath a devil.\n\n7:34 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a\ngluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!\n7:35 But wisdom is justified of all her children.\n\n7:36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him.\nAnd he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.\n\n7:37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she\nknew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an\nalabaster box of ointment, 7:38 And stood at his feet behind him\nweeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with\nthe hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the\nointment.\n\n7:39 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake\nwithin himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have\nknown who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she\nis a sinner.\n\n7:40 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say\nunto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.\n\n7:41 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed\nfive hundred pence, and the other fifty.\n\n7:42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.\nTell me therefore, which of them will love him most?  7:43 Simon\nanswered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most.\n\nAnd he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.\n\n7:44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this\nwoman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my\nfeet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the\nhairs of her head.\n\n7:45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in\nhath not ceased to kiss my feet.\n\n7:46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath\nanointed my feet with ointment.\n\n7:47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are\nforgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same\nloveth little.\n\n7:48 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.\n\n7:49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within\nthemselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?  7:50 And he said to\nthe woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "8:1 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city\nand village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of\nGod: and the twelve were with him, 8:2 And certain women, which had\nbeen healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene,\nout of whom went seven devils, 8:3 And Joanna the wife of Chuza\nHerod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto\nhim of their substance.\n\n8:4 And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him\nout of every city, he spake by a parable: 8:5 A sower went out to sow\nhis seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was\ntrodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.\n\n8:6 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it\nwithered away, because it lacked moisture.\n\n8:7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and\nchoked it.\n\n8:8 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an\nhundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath\nears to hear, let him hear.\n\n8:9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?\n8:10 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the\nkingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not\nsee, and hearing they might not understand.\n\n8:11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.\n\n8:12 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil,\nand taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe\nand be saved.\n\n8:13 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the\nword with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and\nin time of temptation fall away.\n\n8:14 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have\nheard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of\nthis life, and bring no fruit to perfection.\n\n8:15 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good\nheart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with\npatience.\n\n8:16 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel,\nor putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they\nwhich enter in may see the light.\n\n8:17 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither\nany thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.\n\n8:18 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall\nbe given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that\nwhich he seemeth to have.\n\n8:19 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come\nat him for the press.\n\n8:20 And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy\nbrethren stand without, desiring to see thee.\n\n8:21 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are\nthese which hear the word of God, and do it.\n\n8:22 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship\nwith his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the\nother side of the lake. And they launched forth.\n\n8:23 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of\nwind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in\njeopardy.\n\n8:24 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we\nperish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the\nwater: and they ceased, and there was a calm.\n\n8:25 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid\nwondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he\ncommandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.\n\n8:26 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over\nagainst Galilee.\n\n8:27 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a\ncertain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither\nabode in any house, but in the tombs.\n\n8:28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and\nwith a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son\nof God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.\n\n8:29 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.\nFor oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains\nand in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil\ninto the wilderness.)  8:30 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy\nname? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.\n\n8:31 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out\ninto the deep.\n\n8:32 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the\nmountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter\ninto them. And he suffered them.\n\n8:33 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine:\nand the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were\nchoked.\n\n8:34 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went\nand told it in the city and in the country.\n\n8:35 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and\nfound the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the\nfeet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.\n\n8:36 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was\npossessed of the devils was healed.\n\n8:37 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round\nabout besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great\nfear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.\n\n8:38 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him\nthat he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, 8:39\nReturn to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done\nunto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole\ncity how great things Jesus had done unto him.\n\n8:40 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people\ngladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.\n\n8:41 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of\nthe synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that\nhe would come into his house: 8:42 For he had one only daughter, about\ntwelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people\nthronged him.\n\n8:43 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had\nspent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,\n8:44 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and\nimmediately her issue of blood stanched.\n\n8:45 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they\nthat were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press\nthee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?  8:46 And Jesus said, Somebody\nhath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\n\n8:47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling,\nand falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the\npeople for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed\nimmediately.\n\n8:48 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith\nhath made thee whole; go in peace.\n\n8:49 While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the\nsynagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not\nthe Master.\n\n8:50 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not:\nbelieve only, and she shall be made whole.\n\n8:51 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in,\nsave Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the\nmaiden.\n\n8:52 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not\ndead, but sleepeth.\n\n8:53 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.\n\n8:54 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,\nsaying, Maid, arise.\n\n8:55 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he\ncommanded to give her meat.\n\n8:56 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they\nshould tell no man what was done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "9:1 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power\nand authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.\n\n9:2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the\nsick.\n\n9:3 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither\nstaves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two\ncoats apiece.\n\n9:4 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence\ndepart.\n\n9:5 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city,\nshake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.\n\n9:6 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the\ngospel, and healing every where.\n\n9:7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he\nwas perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen\nfrom the dead; 9:8 And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of\nothers, that one of the old prophets was risen again.\n\n9:9 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I\nhear such things? And he desired to see him.\n\n9:10 And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they\nhad done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert\nplace belonging to the city called Bethsaida.\n\n9:11 And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received\nthem, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that\nhad need of healing.\n\n9:12 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and\nsaid unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the\ntowns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are\nhere in a desert place.\n\n9:13 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We\nhave no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and\nbuy meat for all this people.\n\n9:14 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his\ndisciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.\n\n9:15 And they did so, and made them all sit down.\n\n9:16 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up\nto heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to\nset before the multitude.\n\n9:17 And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of\nfragments that remained to them twelve baskets.\n\n9:18 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were\nwith him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?\n9:19 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and\nothers say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.\n\n9:20 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering\nsaid, The Christ of God.\n\n9:21 And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man\nthat thing; 9:22 Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and\nbe rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain,\nand be raised the third day.\n\n9:23 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him\ndeny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.\n\n9:24 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever\nwill lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.\n\n9:25 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and\nlose himself, or be cast away?  9:26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of\nme and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he\nshall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy\nangels.\n\n9:27 But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which\nshall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.\n\n9:28 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he\ntook Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.\n\n9:29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and\nhis raiment was white and glistering.\n\n9:30 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and\nElias: 9:31 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he\nshould accomplish at Jerusalem.\n\n9:32 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and\nwhen they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood\nwith him.\n\n9:33 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto\nJesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three\ntabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not\nknowing what he said.\n\n9:34 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them:\nand they feared as they entered into the cloud.\n\n9:35 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my\nbeloved Son: hear him.\n\n9:36 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept\nit close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they\nhad seen.\n\n9:37 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come\ndown from the hill, much people met him.\n\n9:38 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I\nbeseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.\n\n9:39 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it\nteareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth\nfrom him.\n\n9:40 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.\n\n9:41 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation,\nhow long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.\n\n9:42 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare\nhim.\n\nAnd Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and\ndelivered him again to his father.\n\n9:43 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while\nthey wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto\nhis disciples, 9:44 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for\nthe Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.\n\n9:45 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them,\nthat they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.\n\n9:46 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be\ngreatest.\n\n9:47 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child,\nand set him by him, 9:48 And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive\nthis child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me\nreceiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the\nsame shall be great.\n\n9:49 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils\nin thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.\n\n9:50 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not\nagainst us is for us.\n\n9:51 And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be\nreceived up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, 9:52 And\nsent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a\nvillage of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.\n\n9:53 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he\nwould go to Jerusalem.\n\n9:54 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord,\nwilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume\nthem, even as Elias did?  9:55 But he turned, and rebuked them, and\nsaid, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.\n\n9:56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to\nsave them. And they went to another village.\n\n9:57 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man\nsaid unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.\n\n9:58 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air\nhave nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.\n\n9:59 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me\nfirst to go and bury my father.\n\n9:60 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou\nand preach the kingdom of God.\n\n9:61 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first\ngo bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.\n\n9:62 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the\nplough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall\nhe find faith on the earth?  18:9 And he spake this parable unto\ncertain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and\ndespised others: 18:10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the\none a Pharisee, and the other a publican.\n\n18:11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank\nthee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,\nadulterers, or even as this publican.\n\n18:12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.\n\n18:13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much\nas his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be\nmerciful to me a sinner.\n\n18:14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather\nthan the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased;\nand he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\n\n18:15 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch\nthem: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.\n\n18:16 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children\nto come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of\nGod.\n\n18:17 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom\nof God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.\n\n18:18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I\ndo to inherit eternal life?  18:19 And Jesus said unto him, Why\ncallest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.\n\n18:20 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not\nkill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and\nthy mother.\n\n18:21 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.\n\n18:22 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest\nthou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor,\nand thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.\n\n18:23 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very\nrich.\n\n18:24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How\nhardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!\n18:25 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than\nfor a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\n\n18:26 And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?  18:27 And\nhe said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with\nGod.\n\n18:28 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.\n\n18:29 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man\nthat hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children,\nfor the kingdom of God's sake, 18:30 Who shall not receive manifold\nmore in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.\n\n18:31 Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we\ngo up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets\nconcerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.\n\n18:32 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be\nmocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: 18:33 And they shall\nscourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise\nagain.\n\n18:34 And they understood none of these things: and this saying was\nhid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.\n\n18:35 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a\ncertain blind man sat by the way side begging: 18:36 And hearing the\nmultitude pass by, he asked what it meant.\n\n18:37 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.\n\n18:38 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on\nme.\n\n18:39 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his\npeace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on\nme.\n\n18:40 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and\nwhen he was come near, he asked him, 18:41 Saying, What wilt thou that\nI shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.\n\n18:42 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved\nthee.\n\n18:43 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,\nglorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto\nGod.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up\nthat I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: 19:23 Wherefore\nthen gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might\nhave required mine own with usury?  19:24 And he said unto them that\nstood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten\npounds.\n\n19:25 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)  19:26 For I\nsay unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from\nhim that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.\n\n19:27 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over\nthem, bring hither, and slay them before me.\n\n19:28 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to\nJerusalem.\n\n19:29 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and\nBethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his\ndisciples, 19:30 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in\nthe which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet\nnever man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.\n\n19:31 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say\nunto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.\n\n19:32 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had\nsaid unto them.\n\n19:33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto\nthem, Why loose ye the colt?  19:34 And they said, The Lord hath need\nof him.\n\n19:35 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon\nthe colt, and they set Jesus thereon.\n\n19:36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.\n\n19:37 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount\nof Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and\npraise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had\nseen; 19:38 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the\nLord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.\n\n19:39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto\nhim, Master, rebuke thy disciples.\n\n19:40 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these\nshould hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.\n\n19:41 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,\n19:42 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy\nday, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from\nthine eyes.\n\n19:43 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast\na trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every\nside, 19:44 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children\nwithin thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another;\nbecause thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.\n\n19:45 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that\nsold therein, and them that bought; 19:46 Saying unto them, It is\nwritten, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of\nthieves.\n\n19:47 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the\nscribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, 19:48 And\ncould not find what they might do: for all the people were very\nattentive to hear him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "20:1 And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the\npeople in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and\nthe scribes came upon him with the elders, 20:2 And spake unto him,\nsaying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is\nhe that gave thee this authority?  20:3 And he answered and said unto\nthem, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me: 20:4 The baptism\nof John, was it from heaven, or of men?  20:5 And they reasoned with\nthemselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why\nthen believed ye him not?  20:6 But and if we say, Of men; all the\npeople will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.\n\n20:7 And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.\n\n20:8 And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I\ndo these things.\n\n20:9 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man\nplanted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a\nfar country for a long time.\n\n20:10 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they\nshould give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat\nhim, and sent him away empty.\n\n20:11 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and\nentreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.\n\n20:12 And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast\nhim out.\n\n20:13 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send\nmy beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.\n\n20:14 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves,\nsaying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance\nmay be ours.\n\n20:15 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What\ntherefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?  20:16 He shall\ncome and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to\nothers. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.\n\n20:17 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written,\nThe stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of\nthe corner?  20:18 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be\nbroken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.\n\n20:19 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to\nlay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that\nhe had spoken this parable against them.\n\n20:20 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign\nthemselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so\nthey might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.\n\n20:21 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and\nteachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but\nteachest the way of God truly: 20:22 Is it lawful for us to give\ntribute unto Caesar, or no?  20:23 But he perceived their craftiness,\nand said unto them, Why tempt ye me?  20:24 Shew me a penny. Whose\nimage and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.\n\n20:25 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things\nwhich be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.\n\n20:26 And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and\nthey marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.\n\n20:27 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there\nis any resurrection; and they asked him, 20:28 Saying, Master, Moses\nwrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die\nwithout children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up\nseed unto his brother.\n\n20:29 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife,\nand died without children.\n\n20:30 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.\n\n20:31 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and\nthey left no children, and died.\n\n20:32 Last of all the woman died also.\n\n20:33 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for\nseven had her to wife.\n\n20:34 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world\nmarry, and are given in marriage: 20:35 But they which shall be\naccounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the\ndead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: 20:36 Neither can they\ndie any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children\nof God, being the children of the resurrection.\n\n20:37 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush,\nwhen he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and\nthe God of Jacob.\n\n20:38 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live\nunto him.\n\n20:39 Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast\nwell said.\n\n20:40 And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.\n\n20:41 And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?\n20:42 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said\nunto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 20:43 Till I make thine\nenemies thy footstool.\n\n20:44 David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?  20:45\nThen in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,\n20:46 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and\nlove greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the\nsynagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts; 20:47 Which devour widows'\nhouses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive\ngreater damnation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And Peter followed afar off.\n\n22:55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and\nwere set down together, Peter sat down among them.\n\n22:56 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and\nearnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.\n\n22:57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.\n\n22:58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art\nalso of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.\n\n22:59 And about the space of one hour after another confidently\naffirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is\na Galilaean.\n\n22:60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And\nimmediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.\n\n22:61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered\nthe word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow,\nthou shalt deny me thrice.\n\n22:62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.\n\n22:63 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.\n\n22:64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face,\nand asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?  22:65 And\nmany other things blasphemously spake they against him.\n\n22:66 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the\nchief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their\ncouncil, saying, 22:67 Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto\nthem, If I tell you, ye will not believe: 22:68 And if I also ask you,\nye will not answer me, nor let me go.\n\n22:69 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the\npower of God.\n\n22:70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said\nunto them, Ye say that I am.\n\n22:71 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we\nourselves have heard of his own mouth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "23:1 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.\n\n23:2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow\nperverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar,\nsaying that he himself is Christ a King.\n\n23:3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And\nhe answered him and said, Thou sayest it.\n\n23:4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find\nno fault in this man.\n\n23:5 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people,\nteaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.\n\n23:6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a\nGalilaean.\n\n23:7 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's\njurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem\nat that time.\n\n23:8 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was\ndesirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things\nof him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.\n\n23:9 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him\nnothing.\n\n23:10 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused\nhim.\n\n23:11 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him,\nand arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.\n\n23:12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together:\nfor before they were at enmity between themselves.\n\n23:13 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and\nthe rulers and the people, 23:14 Said unto them, Ye have brought this\nman unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having\nexamined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching\nthose things whereof ye accuse him: 23:15 No, nor yet Herod: for I\nsent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.\n\n23:16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.\n\n23:17 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)\n23:18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and\nrelease unto us Barabbas: 23:19 (Who for a certain sedition made in\nthe city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)  23:20 Pilate\ntherefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.\n\n23:21 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.\n\n23:22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he\ndone? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise\nhim, and let him go.\n\n23:23 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might\nbe crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests\nprevailed.\n\n23:24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.\n\n23:25 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was\ncast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to\ntheir will.\n\n23:26 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a\nCyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross,\nthat he might bear it after Jesus.\n\n23:27 And there followed him a great company of people, and of women,\nwhich also bewailed and lamented him.\n\n23:28 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep\nnot for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.\n\n23:29 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,\nBlessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps\nwhich never gave suck.\n\n23:30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and\nto the hills, Cover us.\n\n23:31 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done\nin the dry?  23:32 And there were also two other, malefactors, led\nwith him to be put to death.\n\n23:33 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,\nthere they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand,\nand the other on the left.\n\n23:34 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what\nthey do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.\n\n23:35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them\nderided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be\nChrist, the chosen of God.\n\n23:36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering\nhim vinegar, 23:37 And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save\nthyself.\n\n23:38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of\nGreek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.\n\n23:39 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,\nsaying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.\n\n23:40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear\nGod, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?  23:41 And we indeed\njustly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath\ndone nothing amiss.\n\n23:42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into\nthy kingdom.\n\n23:43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt\nthou be with me in paradise.\n\n23:44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over\nall the earth until the ninth hour.\n\n23:45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in\nthe midst.\n\n23:46 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,\ninto thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up\nthe ghost.\n\n23:47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,\nsaying, Certainly this was a righteous man.\n\n23:48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding\nthe things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.\n\n23:49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from\nGalilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.\n\n23:50 And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he\nwas a good man, and a just: 23:51 (The same had not consented to the\ncounsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews:\nwho also himself waited for the kingdom of God.\n\n23:52 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.\n\n23:53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a\nsepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.\n\n23:54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.\n\n23:55 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed\nafter, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.\n\n23:56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested\nthe sabbath day according to the commandment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which\nwas a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:\n24:20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be\ncondemned to death, and have crucified him.\n\n24:21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed\nIsrael: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these\nthings were done.\n\n24:22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,\nwhich were early at the sepulchre; 24:23 And when they found not his\nbody, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels,\nwhich said that he was alive.\n\n24:24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,\nand found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.\n\n24:25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe\nall that the prophets have spoken: 24:26 Ought not Christ to have\nsuffered these things, and to enter into his glory?  24:27 And\nbeginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all\nthe scriptures the things concerning himself.\n\n24:28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he\nmade as though he would have gone further.\n\n24:29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is\ntoward evening, and the day is far spent.

        "1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the\nWord was God.\n\n1:2 The same was in the beginning with God.\n\n1:3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing\nmade that was made.\n\n1:4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.\n\n1:5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended\nit not.\n\n1:6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.\n\n1:7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that\nall men through him might believe.\n\n1:8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.\n\n1:9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into\nthe world.\n\n1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world\nknew him not.\n\n1:11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.\n\n1:12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the\nsons of God, even to them that believe on his name: 1:13 Which were\nborn, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of\nman, but of God.\n\n1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld\nhis glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of\ngrace and truth.\n\n1:15 John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom\nI spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was\nbefore me.\n\n1:16 And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.\n\n1:17 For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus\nChrist.\n\n1:18 No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is\nin the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.\n\n1:19 And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and\nLevites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?  1:20 And he\nconfessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.\n\n1:21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am\nnot. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.\n\n1:22 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer\nto them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?  1:23 He said, I am\nthe voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of\nthe Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.\n\n1:24 And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.\n\n1:25 And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then,\nif thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?  1:26\nJohn answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth\none among you, whom ye know not; 1:27 He it is, who coming after me is\npreferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.\n\n1:28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was\nbaptizing.\n\n1:29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold\nthe Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\n\n1:30 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is\npreferred before me: for he was before me.\n\n1:31 And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to\nIsrael, therefore am I come baptizing with water.\n\n1:32 And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from\nheaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.\n\n1:33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water,\nthe same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending,\nand remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy\nGhost.\n\n1:34 And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.\n\n1:35 Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;\n1:36 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of\nGod!  1:37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed\nJesus.\n\n1:38 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them,\nWhat seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being\ninterpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  1:39 He saith unto them,\nCome and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him\nthat day: for it was about the tenth hour.\n\n1:40 One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was\nAndrew, Simon Peter's brother.\n\n1:41 He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We\nhave found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.\n\n1:42 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said,\nThou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is\nby interpretation, A stone.\n\n1:43 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth\nPhilip, and saith unto him, Follow me.\n\n1:44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.\n\n1:45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him,\nof whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of\nNazareth, the son of Joseph.\n\n1:46 And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of\nNazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.\n\n1:47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an\nIsraelite indeed, in whom is no guile!  1:48 Nathanael saith unto him,\nWhence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that\nPhilip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.\n\n1:49 Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of\nGod; thou art the King of Israel.\n\n1:50 Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw\nthee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things\nthan these.\n\n1:51 And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter\nye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and\ndescending upon the Son of man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

 6:61 When Jesus knew in\nhimself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth\nthis offend you?  6:62 What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend\nup where he was before?  6:63 It is the spirit that quickeneth; the\nflesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are\nspirit, and they are life.\n\n6:64 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from\nthe beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray\nhim.\n\n6:65 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto\nme, except it were given unto him of my Father.\n\n6:66 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no\nmore with him.\n\n6:67 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?  6:68 Then\nSimon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the\nwords of eternal life.\n\n6:69 And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of\nthe living God.\n\n6:70 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you\nis a devil?  6:71 He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he\nit was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If thou do these things, shew thyself to\nthe world.\n\n7:5 For neither did his brethren believe in him.\n\n7:6 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time\nis alway ready.\n\n7:7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of\nit, that the works thereof are evil.\n\n7:8 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my\ntime is not yet full come.\n\n7:9 When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.\n\n7:10 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the\nfeast, not openly, but as it were in secret.\n\n7:11 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?\n7:12 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for\nsome said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the\npeople.\n\n7:13 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.\n\n7:14 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple,\nand taught.\n\n7:15 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters,\nhaving never learned?  7:16 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine\nis not mine, but his that sent me.\n\n7:17 If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,\nwhether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.\n\n7:18 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that\nseeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no\nunrighteousness is in him.\n\n7:19 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the\nlaw?  Why go ye about to kill me?  7:20 The people answered and said,\nThou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?  7:21 Jesus answered\nand said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.\n\n7:22 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of\nMoses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a\nman.\n\n7:23 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of\nMoses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a\nman every whit whole on the sabbath day?  7:24 Judge not according to\nthe appearance, but judge righteous judgment.\n\n7:25 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they\nseek to kill?  7:26 But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing\nunto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?\n7:27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no\nman knoweth whence he is.\n\n7:28 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know\nme, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that\nsent me is true, whom ye know not.\n\n7:29 But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.\n\n7:30 Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him,\nbecause his hour was not yet come.\n\n7:31 And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ\ncometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?\n7:32 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things\nconcerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers\nto take him.\n\n7:33 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and\nthen I go unto him that sent me.\n\n7:34 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither\nye cannot come.\n\n7:35 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we\nshall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles,\nand teach the Gentiles?  7:36 What manner of saying is this that he\nsaid, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither\nye cannot come?  7:37 In the last day, that great day of the feast,\nJesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto\nme, and drink.\n\n7:38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his\nbelly shall flow rivers of living water.\n\n7:39 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him\nshould receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that\nJesus was not yet glorified.)  7:40 Many of the people therefore, when\nthey heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.\n\n7:41 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come\nout of Galilee?  7:42 Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh\nof the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David\nwas?  7:43 So there was a division among the people because of him.\n\n7:44 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on\nhim.\n\n7:45 Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and\nthey said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?  7:46 The officers\nanswered, Never man spake like this man.\n\n7:47 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?  7:48\nHave any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?  7:49 But\nthis people who knoweth not the law are cursed.\n\n7:50 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being\none of them,) 7:51 Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and\nknow what he doeth?  7:52 They answered and said unto him, Art thou\nalso of Galilee?  Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no\nprophet.\n\n7:53 And every man went unto his own house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "8:1 Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.\n\n8:2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all\nthe people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.\n\n8:3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in\nadultery; and when they had set her in the midst, 8:4 They say unto\nhim, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.\n\n8:5 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but\nwhat sayest thou?  8:6 This they said, tempting him, that they might\nhave to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote\non the ground, as though he heard them not.\n\n8:7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said\nunto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a\nstone at her.\n\n8:8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.\n\n8:9 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience,\nwent out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and\nJesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.\n\n8:10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he\nsaid unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man\ncondemned thee?  8:11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her,\nNeither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.\n\n8:12 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the\nworld: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have\nthe light of life.\n\n8:13 The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of\nthyself; thy record is not true.\n\n8:14 Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of\nmyself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I\ngo; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.\n\n8:15 Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.\n\n8:16 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but\nI and the Father that sent me.\n\n8:17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is\ntrue.\n\n8:18 I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me\nbeareth witness of me.\n\n8:19 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye\nneither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have\nknown my Father also.\n\n8:20 These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the\ntemple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.\n\n8:21 Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek\nme, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.\n\n8:22 Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith,\nWhither I go, ye cannot come.\n\n8:23 And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye\nare of this world; I am not of this world.\n\n8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if\nye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.\n\n8:25 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them,\nEven the same that I said unto you from the beginning.\n\n8:26 I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent\nme is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard\nof him.\n\n8:27 They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.\n\n8:28 Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man,\nthen shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but\nas my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.\n\n8:29 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me\nalone; for I do always those things that please him.\n\n8:30 As he spake these words, many believed on him.\n\n8:31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye\ncontinue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; 8:32 And ye\nshall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\n\n8:33 They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in\nbondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?  8:34\nJesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever\ncommitteth sin is the servant of sin.\n\n8:35 And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son\nabideth ever.\n\n8:36 If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free\nindeed.\n\n8:37 I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me,\nbecause my word hath no place in you.\n\n8:38 I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that\nwhich ye have seen with your father.\n\n8:39 They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus\nsaith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works\nof Abraham.\n\n8:40 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth,\nwhich I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.\n\n8:41 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not\nborn of fornication; we have one Father, even God.\n\n8:42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me:\nfor I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but\nhe sent me.\n\n8:43 Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear\nmy word.\n\n8:44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye\nwill do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the\ntruth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he\nspeaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.\n\n8:45 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.\n\n8:46 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do\nye not believe me?  8:47 He that is of God heareth God's words: ye\ntherefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.\n\n8:48 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that\nthou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?  8:49 Jesus answered, I have\nnot a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.\n\n8:50 And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and\njudgeth.\n\n8:51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall\nnever see death.\n\n8:52 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.\n\nAbraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my\nsaying, he shall never taste of death.\n\n8:53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the\nprophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?  8:54 Jesus answered, If\nI honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth\nme; of whom ye say, that he is your God: 8:55 Yet ye have not known\nhim; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a\nliar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.\n\n8:56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and\nwas glad.\n\n8:57 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old,\nand hast thou seen Abraham?  8:58 Jesus said unto them, Verily,\nverily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.\n\n8:59 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself,\nand went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so\npassed by.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "9:1 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his\nbirth.\n\n9:2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this\nman, or his parents, that he was born blind?  9:3 Jesus answered,\nNeither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of\nGod should be made manifest in him.\n\n9:4 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the\nnight cometh, when no man can work.\n\n9:5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\n\n9:6 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of\nthe spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,\n9:7 And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by\ninterpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came\nseeing.\n\n9:8 The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that\nhe was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?  9:9 Some\nsaid, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.\n\n9:10 Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?  9:11\nHe answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and\nanointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and\nwash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.\n\n9:12 Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.\n\n9:13 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.\n\n9:14 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened\nhis eyes.\n\n9:15 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his\nsight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed,\nand do see.\n\n9:16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,\nbecause he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man\nthat is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among\nthem.\n\n9:17 They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that\nhe hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.\n\n9:18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been\nblind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him\nthat had received his sight.\n\n9:19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was\nborn blind? how then doth he now see?  9:20 His parents answered them\nand said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:\n9:21 But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened\nhis eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for\nhimself.\n\n9:22 These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for\nthe Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was\nChrist, he should be put out of the synagogue.\n\n9:23 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.\n\n9:24 Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him,\nGive God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.\n\n9:25 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not:\none thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.\n\n9:26 Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he\nthine eyes?  9:27 He answered them, I have told you already, and ye\ndid not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his\ndisciples?  9:28 Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his\ndisciple; but we are Moses' disciples.\n\n9:29 We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know\nnot from whence he is.\n\n9:30 The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous\nthing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine\neyes.\n\n9:31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a\nworshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.\n\n9:32 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the\neyes of one that was born blind.\n\n9:33 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.\n\n9:34 They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in\nsins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.\n\n9:35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found\nhim, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?  9:36 He\nanswered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?  9:37\nAnd Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that\ntalketh with thee.\n\n9:38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.\n\n9:39 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they\nwhich see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.\n\n9:40 And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words,\nand said unto him, Are we blind also?  9:41 Jesus said unto them, If\nye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see;\ntherefore your sin remaineth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.\n\n10:25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works\nthat I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.\n\n10:26 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said\nunto you.\n\n10:27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:\n10:28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,\nneither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.\n\n10:29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man\nis able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.\n\n10:30 I and my Father are one.\n\n10:31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.\n\n10:32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my\nFather; for which of those works do ye stone me?  10:33 The Jews\nanswered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for\nblasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.\n\n10:34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye\nare gods?  10:35 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God\ncame, and the scripture cannot be broken; 10:36 Say ye of him, whom\nthe Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest;\nbecause I said, I am the Son of God?  10:37 If I do not the works of\nmy Father, believe me not.\n\n10:38 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that\nye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.\n\n10:39 Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of\ntheir hand, 10:40 And went away again beyond Jordan into the place\nwhere John at first baptized; and there he abode.\n\n10:41 And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but\nall things that John spake of this man were true.\n\n10:42 And many believed on him there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If any man walk in the day, he\nstumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.\n\n11:10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is\nno light in him.\n\n11:11 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our\nfriend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.\n\n11:12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.\n\n11:13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had\nspoken of taking of rest in sleep.\n\n11:14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.\n\n11:15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent\nye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.\n\n11:16 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his\nfellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.\n\n11:17 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave\nfour days already.\n\n11:18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:\n11:19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them\nconcerning their brother.\n\n11:20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went\nand met him: but Mary sat still in the house.\n\n11:21 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my\nbrother had not died.\n\n11:22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God\nwill give it thee.\n\n11:23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.\n\n11:24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the\nresurrection at the last day.\n\n11:25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he\nthat believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: 11:26\nAnd whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest\nthou this?  11:27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou\nart the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.\n\n11:28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her\nsister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.\n\n11:29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.\n\n11:30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place\nwhere Martha met him.\n\n11:31 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted\nher, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out,\nfollowed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.\n\n11:32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell\ndown at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my\nbrother had not died.\n\n11:33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping\nwhich came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.\n\n11:34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come\nand see.\n\n11:35 Jesus wept.\n\n11:36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!  11:37 And some of\nthem said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind,\nhave caused that even this man should not have died?  11:38 Jesus\ntherefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a\ncave, and a stone lay upon it.\n\n11:39 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him\nthat was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he\nhath been dead four days.\n\n11:40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou\nwouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?  11:41 Then\nthey took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And\nJesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou\nhast heard me.\n\n11:42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the\npeople which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast\nsent me.\n\n11:43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,\nLazarus, come forth.\n\n11:44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with\ngraveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith\nunto them, Loose him, and let him go.\n\n11:45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the\nthings which Jesus did, believed on him.\n\n11:46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them\nwhat things Jesus had done.\n\n11:47 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and\nsaid, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.\n\n11:48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the\nRomans shall come and take away both our place and nation.\n\n11:49 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same\nyear, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, 11:50 Nor consider that\nit is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and\nthat the whole nation perish not.\n\n11:51 And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that\nyear, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; 11:52 And\nnot for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in\none the children of God that were scattered abroad.\n\n11:53 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put\nhim to death.\n\n11:54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went\nthence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called\nEphraim, and there continued with his disciples.\n\n11:55 And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of\nthe country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.\n\n11:56 Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they\nstood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the\nfeast?  11:57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a\ncommandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it,\nthat they might take him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "12:1 Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where\nLazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.\n\n12:2 There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was\none of them that sat at the table with him.\n\n12:3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and\nanointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the\nhouse was filled with the odour of the ointment.\n\n12:4 Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son,\nwhich should betray him, 12:5 Why was not this ointment sold for three\nhundred pence, and given to the poor?  12:6 This he said, not that he\ncared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and\nbare what was put therein.\n\n12:7 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying\nhath she kept this.\n\n12:8 For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.\n\n12:9 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and\nthey came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus\nalso, whom he had raised from the dead.\n\n12:10 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also\nto death; 12:11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went\naway, and believed on Jesus.\n\n12:12 On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when\nthey heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 12:13 Took branches of\npalm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is\nthe King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.\n\n12:14 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is\nwritten, 12:15 Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh,\nsitting on an ass's colt.\n\n12:16 These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when\nJesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were\nwritten of him, and that they had done these things unto him.\n\n12:17 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus\nout of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.\n\n12:18 For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that\nhe had done this miracle.\n\n12:19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how\nye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.\n\n12:20 And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship\nat the feast: 12:21 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of\nBethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see\nJesus.\n\n12:22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip\ntell Jesus.\n\n12:23 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son\nof man should be glorified.\n\n12:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into\nthe ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth\nmuch fruit.\n\n12:25 He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his\nlife in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.\n\n12:26 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there\nshall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father\nhonour.\n\n12:27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me\nfrom this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.\n\n12:28 Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,\nsaying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.\n\n12:29 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it\nthundered: others said, An angel spake to him.\n\n12:30 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but\nfor your sakes.\n\n12:31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this\nworld be cast out.\n\n12:32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto\nme.\n\n12:33 This he said, signifying what death he should die.\n\n12:34 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that\nChrist abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be\nlifted up? who is this Son of man?  12:35 Then Jesus said unto them,\nYet a little while is the light with you.\n\nWalk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that\nwalketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.\n\n12:36 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the\nchildren of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did\nhide himself from them.\n\n12:37 But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they\nbelieved not on him: 12:38 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might\nbe fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and\nto whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?  12:39 Therefore they\ncould not believe, because that Esaias said again, 12:40 He hath\nblinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see\nwith their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted,\nand I should heal them.\n\n12:41 These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of\nhim.\n\n12:42 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him;\nbut because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they\nshould be put out of the synagogue: 12:43 For they loved the praise of\nmen more than the praise of God.\n\n12:44 Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on\nme, but on him that sent me.\n\n12:45 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.\n\n12:46 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me\nshould not abide in darkness.\n\n12:47 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not:\nfor I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.\n\n12:48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that\njudgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in\nthe last day.\n\n12:49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me,\nhe gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.\n\n12:50 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever\nI speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Jesus\nanswered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.\n\n13:9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my\nhands and my head.\n\n13:10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash\nhis feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.\n\n13:11 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not\nall clean.\n\n13:12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments,\nand was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to\nyou?  13:13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.\n\n13:14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also\nought to wash one another's feet.\n\n13:15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have\ndone to you.\n\n13:16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than\nhis lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.\n\n13:17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.\n\n13:18 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the\nscripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted\nup his heel against me.\n\n13:19 Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye\nmay believe that I am he.\n\n13:20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I\nsend receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent\nme.\n\n13:21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and\ntestified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you\nshall betray me.\n\n13:22 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he\nspake.\n\n13:23 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom\nJesus loved.\n\n13:24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it\nshould be of whom he spake.\n\n13:25 He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?\n13:26 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I\nhave dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas\nIscariot, the son of Simon.\n\n13:27 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto\nhim, That thou doest, do quickly.\n\n13:28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto\nhim.\n\n13:29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus\nhad said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the\nfeast; or, that he should give something to the poor.\n\n13:30 He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was\nnight.\n\n13:31 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of\nman glorified, and God is glorified in him.\n\n13:32 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in\nhimself, and shall straightway glorify him.\n\n13:33 Little children, yet a little while I am with you.

Jesus\nanswered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou\nshalt follow me afterwards.\n\n13:37 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will\nlay down my life for thy sake.\n\n13:38 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?\nVerily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou\nhast denied me thrice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "18:1 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his\ndisciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he\nentered, and his disciples.\n\n18:2 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus\nofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.\n\n18:3 Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the\nchief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches\nand weapons.\n\n18:4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him,\nwent forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?  18:5 They answered him,\nJesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he.\n\nAnd Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.\n\n18:6 As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went\nbackward, and fell to the ground.\n\n18:7 Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of\nNazareth.\n\n18:8 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye\nseek me, let these go their way: 18:9 That the saying might be\nfulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost\nnone.\n\n18:10 Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high\npriest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was\nMalchus.\n\n18:11 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath:\nthe cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?  18:12\nThen the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and\nbound him, 18:13 And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in\nlaw to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.\n\n18:14 Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was\nexpedient that one man should die for the people.\n\n18:15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple:\nthat disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus\ninto the palace of the high priest.\n\n18:16 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other\ndisciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her\nthat kept the door, and brought in Peter.\n\n18:17 Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not\nthou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.\n\n18:18 And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire\nof coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood\nwith them, and warmed himself.\n\n18:19 The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his\ndoctrine.\n\n18:20 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught\nin the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort;\nand in secret have I said nothing.\n\n18:21 Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said\nunto them: behold, they know what I said.\n\n18:22 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by\nstruck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the\nhigh priest so?  18:23 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear\nwitness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?  18:24 Now\nAnnas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.\n\n18:25 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore\nunto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and\nsaid, I am not.\n\n18:26 One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose\near Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?\n18:27 Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.\n\n18:28 Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and\nit was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall,\nlest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.\n\n18:29 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring\nye against this man?  18:30 They answered and said unto him, If he\nwere not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.\n\n18:31 Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according\nto your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us\nto put any man to death: 18:32 That the saying of Jesus might be\nfulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.\n\n18:33 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called\nJesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?  18:34 Jesus\nanswered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it\nthee of me?  18:35 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and\nthe chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?\n18:36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom\nwere of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be\ndelivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.\n\n18:37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus\nanswered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and\nfor this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto\nthe truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.\n\n18:38 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this,\nhe went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no\nfault at all.\n\n18:39 But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the\npassover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the\nJews?  18:40 Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but\nBarabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "19:1 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.\n\n19:2 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his\nhead, and they put on him a purple robe, 19:3 And said, Hail, King of\nthe Jews! and they smote him with their hands.\n\n19:4 Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I\nbring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.\n\n19:5 Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the\npurple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!  19:6 When\nthe chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out,\nsaying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him,\nand crucify him: for I find no fault in him.\n\n19:7 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to\ndie, because he made himself the Son of God.\n\n19:8 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;\n19:9 And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus,\nWhence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.\n\n19:10 Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest\nthou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release\nthee?  19:11 Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all\nagainst me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that\ndelivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.\n\n19:12 And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews\ncried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's\nfriend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.\n\n19:13 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth,\nand sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the\nPavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.\n\n19:14 And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth\nhour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!  19:15 But they\ncried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him.\n\nPilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests\nanswered, We have no king but Caesar.\n\n19:16 Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And\nthey took Jesus, and led him away.\n\n19:17 And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the\nplace of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: 19:18 Where\nthey crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and\nJesus in the midst.\n\n19:19 And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the\nwriting was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.\n\n19:20 This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus\nwas crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and\nGreek, and Latin.\n\n19:21 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not,\nThe King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.\n\n19:22 Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.\n\n19:23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his\ngarments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his\ncoat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.\n\n19:24 They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but\ncast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be\nfulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my\nvesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.\n\n19:25 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his\nmother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.\n\n19:26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing\nby, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!\n19:27 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that\nhour that disciple took her unto his own home.\n\n19:28 After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished,\nthat the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.\n\n19:29 Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a\nspunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.\n\n19:30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is\nfinished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.\n\n19:31 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the\nbodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that\nsabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be\nbroken, and that they might be taken away.\n\n19:32 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of\nthe other which was crucified with him.\n\n19:33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already,\nthey brake not his legs: 19:34 But one of the soldiers with a spear\npierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.\n\n19:35 And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he\nknoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.\n\n19:36 For these things were done, that the scripture should be\nfulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.\n\n19:37 And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom\nthey pierced.\n\n19:38 And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus,\nbut secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take\naway the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore,\nand took the body of Jesus.\n\n19:39 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus\nby night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred\npound weight.\n\n19:40 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes\nwith the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.\n\n19:41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and\nin the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.\n\n19:42 There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation\nday; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "20:1 The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it\nwas yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from\nthe sepulchre.\n\n20:2 Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other\ndisciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away\nthe LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid\nhim.\n\n20:3 Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to\nthe sepulchre.\n\n20:4 So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun\nPeter, and came first to the sepulchre.\n\n20:5 And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes\nlying; yet went he not in.\n\n20:6 Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the\nsepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, 20:7 And the napkin, that\nwas about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped\ntogether in a place by itself.\n\n20:8 Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the\nsepulchre, and he saw, and believed.\n\n20:9 For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again\nfrom the dead.\n\n20:10 Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.\n\n20:11 But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she\nwept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, 20:12 And seeth\ntwo angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the\nfeet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\n\n20:13 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto\nthem, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they\nhave laid him.\n\n20:14 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw\nJesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.\n\n20:15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest\nthou?  She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if\nthou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I\nwill take him away.\n\n20:16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto\nhim, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.\n\n20:17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to\nmy Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my\nFather, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\n\n20:18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the\nLORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.\n\n20:19 Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,\nwhen the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear\nof the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them,\nPeace be unto you.\n\n20:20 And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his\nside.\n\nThen were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.\n\n20:21 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father\nhath sent me, even so send I you.\n\n20:22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto\nthem, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: 20:23 Whose soever sins ye remit,\nthey are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are\nretained.\n\n20:24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them\nwhen Jesus came.\n\n20:25 The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the\nLORD.\n\nBut he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of\nthe nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust\nmy hand into his side, I will not believe.\n\n20:26 And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas\nwith them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the\nmidst, and said, Peace be unto you.\n\n20:27 Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my\nhands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be\nnot faithless, but believing.\n\n20:28 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.\n\n20:29 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou\nhast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have\nbelieved.\n\n20:30 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his\ndisciples, which are not written in this book: 20:31 But these are\nwritten, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of\nGod; and that believing ye might have life through his name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "21:1 After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at\nthe sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.\n\n21:2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and\nNathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other\nof his disciples.\n\n21:3 Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him,\nWe also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship\nimmediately; and that night they caught nothing.\n\n21:4 But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but\nthe disciples knew not that it was Jesus.\n\n21:5 Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They\nanswered him, No.\n\n21:6 And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the\nship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not\nable to draw it for the multitude of fishes.\n\n21:7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is\nthe Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his\nfisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into\nthe sea.\n\n21:8 And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not\nfar from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net\nwith fishes.\n\n21:9 As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals\nthere, and fish laid thereon, and bread.\n\n21:10 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now\ncaught.\n\n21:11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great\nfishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so\nmany, yet was not the net broken.\n\n21:12 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples\ndurst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.\n\n21:13 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish\nlikewise.\n\n21:14 This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his\ndisciples, after that he was risen from the dead.\n\n21:15 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son\nof Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea,\nLord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.\n\n21:16 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas,\nlovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love\nthee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.\n\n21:17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest\nthou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time,\nLovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things;\nthou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.\n\n21:18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou\ngirdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou\nshalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall\ngird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.\n\n21:19 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.\nAnd when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.\n\n21:20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved\nfollowing; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord,\nwhich is he that betrayeth thee?  21:21 Peter seeing him saith to\nJesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?  21:22 Jesus saith unto him,\nIf I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou\nme.\n\n21:23 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that\ndisciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not\ndie; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?\n21:24 This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote\nthese things: and we know that his testimony is true.\n\n21:25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which,\nif they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world\nitself could not contain the books that should be written.

        "1:1 The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus\nbegan both to do and teach, 1:2 Until the day in which he was taken\nup, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto\nthe apostles whom he had chosen: 1:3 To whom also he shewed himself\nalive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them\nforty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of\nGod: 1:4 And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that\nthey should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the\nFather, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.\n\n1:5 For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with\nthe Holy Ghost not many days hence.\n\n1:6 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying,\nLord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?  1:7\nAnd he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the\nseasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.\n\n1:8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon\nyou: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all\nJudaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\n\n1:9 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was\ntaken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.\n\n1:10 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up,\nbehold, two men stood by them in white apparel; 1:11 Which also said,\nYe men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same\nJesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like\nmanner as ye have seen him go into heaven.\n\n1:12 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet,\nwhich is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.\n\n1:13 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room,\nwhere abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and\nThomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon\nZelotes, and Judas the brother of James.\n\n1:14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication,\nwith the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.\n\n1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples,\nand said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and\ntwenty,) 1:16 Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been\nfulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before\nconcerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.\n\n1:17 For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this\nministry.\n\n1:18 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and\nfalling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels\ngushed out.\n\n1:19 And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as\nthat field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say,\nThe field of blood.\n\n1:20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be\ndesolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another\ntake.\n\n1:21 Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time\nthat the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 1:22 Beginning from the\nbaptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must\none be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.\n\n1:23 And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed\nJustus, and Matthias.\n\n1:24 And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts\nof all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen, 1:25 That he\nmay take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by\ntransgression fell, that he might go to his own place.\n\n1:26 And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias;\nand he was numbered with the eleven apostles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "2:1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with\none accord in one place.\n\n2:2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty\nwind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.\n\n2:3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and\nit sat upon each of them.\n\n2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak\nwith other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.\n\n2:5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of\nevery nation under heaven.\n\n2:6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and\nwere confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own\nlanguage.\n\n2:7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another,\nBehold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?  2:8 And how hear we\nevery man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  2:9 Parthians, and\nMedes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea,\nand Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, 2:10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in\nEgypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,\nJews and proselytes, 2:11 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak\nin our tongues the wonderful works of God.\n\n2:12 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to\nanother, What meaneth this?  2:13 Others mocking said, These men are\nfull of new wine.\n\n2:14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and\nsaid unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem,\nbe this known unto you, and hearken to my words: 2:15 For these are\nnot drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the\nday.\n\n2:16 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; 2:17 And\nit shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of\nmy Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall\nprophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall\ndream dreams: 2:18 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will\npour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy: 2:19 And\nI will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath;\nblood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: 2:20 The sun shall be turned\ninto darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable\nday of the Lord come: 2:21 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever\nshall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\n\n2:22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man\napproved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God\ndid by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: 2:23 Him,\nbeing delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God,\nye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: 2:24 Whom\nGod hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was\nnot possible that he should be holden of it.\n\n2:25 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always\nbefore my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be\nmoved: 2:26 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad;\nmoreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: 2:27 Because thou wilt not\nleave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see\ncorruption.\n\n2:28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me\nfull of joy with thy countenance.\n\n2:29 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch\nDavid, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us\nunto this day.\n\n2:30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an\noath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh,\nhe would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; 2:31 He seeing this\nbefore spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left\nin hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.\n\n2:32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.\n\n2:33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having\nreceived of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed\nforth this, which ye now see and hear.\n\n2:34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself,\nThe Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I\nmake thy foes thy footstool.\n\n2:36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God\nhath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and\nChrist.\n\n2:37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and\nsaid unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren,\nwhat shall we do?  2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be\nbaptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the\nremission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\n\n2:39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all\nthat are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.\n\n2:40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save\nyourselves from this untoward generation.\n\n2:41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the\nsame day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.\n\n2:42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and\nfellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.\n\n2:43 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were\ndone by the apostles.\n\n2:44 And all that believed were together, and had all things common;\n2:45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,\nas every man had need.\n\n2:46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and\nbreaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness\nand singleness of heart, 2:47 Praising God, and having favour with all\nthe people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be\nsaved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Now therefore are we all here present before God,\nto hear all things that are commanded thee of God.\n\n10:34 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive\nthat God is no respecter of persons: 10:35 But in every nation he that\nfeareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.\n\n10:36 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching\npeace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:) 10:37 That word, I say, ye\nknow, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from\nGalilee, after the baptism which John preached; 10:38 How God anointed\nJesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about\ndoing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God\nwas with him.\n\n10:39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land\nof the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:\n10:40 Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; 10:41\nNot to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God, even to\nus, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.\n\n10:42 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify\nthat it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and\ndead.\n\n10:43 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name\nwhosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.\n\n10:44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all\nthem which heard the word.\n\n10:45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as\nmany as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured\nout the gift of the Holy Ghost.\n\n10:46 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then\nanswered Peter, 10:47 Can any man forbid water, that these should not\nbe baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?  10:48\nAnd he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then\nprayed they him to tarry certain days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "11:1 And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the\nGentiles had also received the word of God.\n\n11:2 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the\ncircumcision contended with him, 11:3 Saying, Thou wentest in to men\nuncircumcised, and didst eat with them.\n\n11:4 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded\nit by order unto them, saying, 11:5 I was in the city of Joppa\npraying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as\nit had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and\nit came even to me: 11:6 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes,\nI considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts,\nand creeping things, and fowls of the air.\n\n11:7 And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.\n\n11:8 But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at\nany time entered into my mouth.\n\n11:9 But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath\ncleansed, that call not thou common.\n\n11:10 And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into\nheaven.\n\n11:11 And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto\nthe house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.\n\n11:12 And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover\nthese six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's\nhouse: 11:13 And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house,\nwhich stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon,\nwhose surname is Peter; 11:14 Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou\nand all thy house shall be saved.\n\n11:15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us\nat the beginning.\n\n11:16 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John\nindeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy\nGhost.\n\n11:17 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us,\nwho believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could\nwithstand God?  11:18 When they heard these things, they held their\npeace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles\ngranted repentance unto life.\n\n11:19 Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that\narose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and\nAntioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.\n\n11:20 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they\nwere come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the LORD\nJesus.\n\n11:21 And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number\nbelieved, and turned unto the Lord.\n\n11:22 Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church\nwhich was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should\ngo as far as Antioch.\n\n11:23 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and\nexhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto\nthe Lord.\n\n11:24 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith:\nand much people was added unto the Lord.\n\n11:25 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: 11:26 And\nwhen he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to\npass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and\ntaught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in\nAntioch.\n\n11:27 And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.\n\n11:28 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by\nthe Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world:\nwhich came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.\n\n11:29 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability,\ndetermined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:\n11:30 Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of\nBarnabas and Saul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "17:1 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they\ncame to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: 17:2 And\nPaul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days\nreasoned with them out of the scriptures, 17:3 Opening and alleging,\nthat Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead;\nand that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.\n\n17:4 And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and\nof the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a\nfew.\n\n17:5 But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them\ncertain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and\nset all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and\nsought to bring them out to the people.\n\n17:6 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain\nbrethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned\nthe world upside down are come hither also; 17:7 Whom Jason hath\nreceived: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying\nthat there is another king, one Jesus.\n\n17:8 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when\nthey heard these things.\n\n17:9 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they\nlet them go.\n\n17:10 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night\nunto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.\n\n17:11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they\nreceived the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the\nscriptures daily, whether those things were so.\n\n17:12 Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which\nwere Greeks, and of men, not a few.\n\n17:13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of\nGod was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred\nup the people.\n\n17:14 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it\nwere to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.\n\n17:15 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and\nreceiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him\nwith all speed, they departed.\n\n17:16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred\nin him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.\n\n17:17 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with\nthe devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with\nhim.\n\n17:18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,\nencountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other\nsome, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he\npreached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.\n\n17:19 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May\nwe know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?  17:20 For\nthou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know\ntherefore what these things mean.\n\n17:21 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent\ntheir time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new\nthing.)  17:22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said,\nYe men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too\nsuperstitious.\n\n17:23 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar\nwith this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.

And Gallio cared for\nnone of those things.\n\n18:18 And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then\ntook his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with\nhim Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he\nhad a vow.\n\n18:19 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself\nentered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.\n\n18:20 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he\nconsented not; 18:21 But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all\nmeans keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return\nagain unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.\n\n18:22 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the\nchurch, he went down to Antioch.\n\n18:23 And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went\nover all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening\nall the disciples.\n\n18:24 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent\nman, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.\n\n18:25 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being\nfervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of\nthe Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.\n\n18:26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila\nand Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto\nhim the way of God more perfectly.\n\n18:27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren\nwrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come,\nhelped them much which had believed through grace: 18:28 For he\nmightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the\nscriptures that Jesus was Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And they\nsaid, Unto John's baptism.\n\n19:4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of\nrepentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him\nwhich should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.\n\n19:5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord\nJesus.\n\n19:6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came\non them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.\n\n19:7 And all the men were about twelve.\n\n19:8 And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of\nthree months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the\nkingdom of God.\n\n19:9 But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil\nof that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated\nthe disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.\n\n19:10 And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they\nwhich dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and\nGreeks.\n\n19:11 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: 19:12 So\nthat from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons,\nand the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of\nthem.\n\n19:13 Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to\ncall over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus,\nsaying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.\n\n19:14 And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the\npriests, which did so.\n\n19:15 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I\nknow; but who are ye?  19:16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was\nleaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that\nthey fled out of that house naked and wounded.\n\n19:17 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at\nEphesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was\nmagnified.\n\n19:18 And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their\ndeeds.\n\n19:19 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books\ntogether, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price\nof them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.\n\n19:20 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.\n\n19:21 After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when\nhe had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem,\nsaying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.\n\n19:22 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him,\nTimotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.\n\n19:23 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.\n\n19:24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made\nsilver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;\n19:25 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and\nsaid, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.\n\n19:26 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost\nthroughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much\npeople, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands: 19:27\nSo that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but\nalso that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised,\nand her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world\nworshippeth.\n\n19:28 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and\ncried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.\n\n19:29 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught\nGaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel,\nthey rushed with one accord into the theatre.\n\n19:30 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the\ndisciples suffered him not.\n\n19:31 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent\nunto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the\ntheatre.\n\n19:32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the\nassembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were\ncome together.\n\n19:33 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting\nhim forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made\nhis defence unto the people.\n\n19:34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about\nthe space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.\n\n19:35 And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men\nof Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of\nthe Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the\nimage which fell down from Jupiter?  19:36 Seeing then that these\nthings cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do\nnothing rashly.\n\n19:37 For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers\nof churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.\n\n19:38 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him,\nhave a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are\ndeputies: let them implead one another.\n\n19:39 But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall\nbe determined in a lawful assembly.\n\n19:40 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's\nuproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this\nconcourse.\n\n19:41 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

and\nthe next day we came to Miletus.\n\n20:16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not\nspend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to\nbe at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.\n\n20:17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of\nthe church.\n\n20:18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from\nthe first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been\nwith you at all seasons, 20:19 Serving the LORD with all humility of\nmind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the\nlying in wait of the Jews: 20:20 And how I kept back nothing that was\nprofitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you\npublickly, and from house to house, 20:21 Testifying both to the Jews,\nand also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our\nLord Jesus Christ.\n\n20:22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not\nknowing the things that shall befall me there: 20:23 Save that the\nHoly Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions\nabide me.\n\n20:24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear\nunto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the\nministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the\ngospel of the grace of God.\n\n20:25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone\npreaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.\n\n20:26 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the\nblood of all men.\n\n20:27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of\nGod.\n\n20:28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over\nthe which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church\nof God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.\n\n20:29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves\nenter in among you, not sparing the flock.\n\n20:30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse\nthings, to draw away disciples after them.\n\n20:31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years\nI ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.\n\n20:32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his\ngrace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance\namong all them which are sanctified.\n\n20:33 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.\n\n20:34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto\nmy necessities, and to them that were with me.\n\n20:35 I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to\nsupport the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he\nsaid, It is more blessed to give than to receive.\n\n20:36 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with\nthem all.\n\n20:37 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,\n20:38 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they\nshould see his face no more.

 for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at\nJerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.\n\n21:14 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will\nof the Lord be done.\n\n21:15 And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to\nJerusalem.\n\n21:16 There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea,\nand brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom\nwe should lodge.\n\n21:17 And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us\ngladly.\n\n21:18 And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all\nthe elders were present.\n\n21:19 And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what\nthings God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.\n\n21:20 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto\nhim, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which\nbelieve; and they are all zealous of the law: 21:21 And they are\ninformed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the\nGentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise\ntheir children, neither to walk after the customs.\n\n21:22 What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together:\nfor they will hear that thou art come.\n\n21:23 Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which\nhave a vow on them; 21:24 Them take, and purify thyself with them, and\nbe at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may\nknow that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee,\nare nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest\nthe law.\n\n21:25 As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and\nconcluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep\nthemselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from\nstrangled, and from fornication.\n\n21:26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with\nthem entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the\ndays of purification, until that an offering should be offered for\nevery one of them.\n\n21:27 And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were\nof Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people,\nand laid hands on him, 21:28 Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is\nthe man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the\nlaw, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple,\nand hath polluted this holy place.\n\n21:29 (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an\nEphesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)\n21:30 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and\nthey took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the\ndoors were shut.\n\n21:31 And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief\ncaptain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.\n\n21:32 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto\nthem: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left\nbeating of Paul.\n\n21:33 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded\nhim to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he\nhad done.\n\n21:34 And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and\nwhen he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him\nto be carried into the castle.\n\n21:35 And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne\nof the soldiers for the violence of the people.\n\n21:36 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away\nwith him.\n\n21:37 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the\nchief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak\nGreek?  21:38 Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days\nmadest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand\nmen that were murderers?  21:39 But Paul said, I am a man which am a\nJew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I\nbeseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.\n\n21:40 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and\nbeckoned with the hand unto the people.

And the same\nhour I looked up upon him.\n\n22:14 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou\nshouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the\nvoice of his mouth.\n\n22:15 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast\nseen and heard.\n\n22:16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away\nthy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.\n\n22:17 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem,\neven while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance; 22:18 And saw\nhim saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem:\nfor they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.\n\n22:19 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every\nsynagogue them that believed on thee: 22:20 And when the blood of thy\nmartyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto\nhis death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.\n\n22:21 And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto\nthe Gentiles.\n\n22:22 And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up\ntheir voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it\nis not fit that he should live.\n\n22:23 And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw\ndust into the air, 22:24 The chief captain commanded him to be brought\ninto the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging;\nthat he might know wherefore they cried so against him.\n\n22:25 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion\nthat stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman,\nand uncondemned?  22:26 When the centurion heard that, he went and\ntold the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this\nman is a Roman.\n\n22:27 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art\nthou a Roman? He said, Yea.\n\n22:28 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this\nfreedom.

Wherefore\nI have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king\nAgrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.\n\n25:27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not\nwithal to signify the crimes laid against him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "26:1 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for\nthyself.\n\nThen Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself: 26:2 I\nthink myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself\nthis day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of\nthe Jews: 26:3 Especially because I know thee to be expert in all\ncustoms and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech\nthee to hear me patiently.\n\n26:4 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among\nmine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; 26:5 Which knew me\nfrom the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most\nstraitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.\n\n26:6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of\nGod, unto our fathers: 26:7 Unto which promise our twelve tribes,\ninstantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's\nsake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.\n\n26:8 Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God\nshould raise the dead?  26:9 I verily thought with myself, that I\nought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.\n\n26:10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did\nI shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests;\nand when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.\n\n26:11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them\nto blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted\nthem even unto strange cities.\n\n26:12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission\nfrom the chief priests, 26:13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a\nlight from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round\nabout me and them which journeyed with me.\n\n26:14 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice\nspeaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why\npersecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.\n\n26:15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom\nthou persecutest.\n\n26:16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee\nfor this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these\nthings which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will\nappear unto thee; 26:17 Delivering thee from the people, and from the\nGentiles, unto whom now I send thee, 26:18 To open their eyes, and to\nturn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto\nGod, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among\nthem which are sanctified by faith that is in me.\n\n26:19 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the\nheavenly vision: 26:20 But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at\nJerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the\nGentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet\nfor repentance.\n\n26:21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went\nabout to kill me.\n\n26:22 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day,\nwitnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than\nthose which the prophets and Moses did say should come: 26:23 That\nChrist should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise\nfrom the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the\nGentiles.\n\n26:24 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice,\nPaul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.\n\n26:25 But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth\nthe words of truth and soberness.\n\n26:26 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak\nfreely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from\nhim; for this thing was not done in a corner.\n\n26:27 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou\nbelievest.\n\n26:28 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a\nChristian.\n\n26:29 And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all\nthat hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am,\nexcept these bonds.\n\n26:30 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor,\nand Bernice, and they that sat with them: 26:31 And when they were\ngone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth\nnothing worthy of death or of bonds.\n\n26:32 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at\nliberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "27:1 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they\ndelivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a\ncenturion of Augustus' band.\n\n27:2 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to\nsail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of\nThessalonica, being with us.\n\n27:3 And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously\nentreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh\nhimself.\n\n27:4 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus,\nbecause the winds were contrary.\n\n27:5 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we\ncame to Myra, a city of Lycia.\n\n27:6 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into\nItaly; and he put us therein.\n\n27:7 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come\nover against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete,\nover against Salmone; 27:8 And, hardly passing it, came unto a place\nwhich is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.\n\n27:9 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous,\nbecause the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them, 27:10 And\nsaid unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt\nand much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our\nlives.\n\n27:11 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of\nthe ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.\n\n27:12 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more\npart advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain\nto Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth\ntoward the south west and north west.\n\n27:13 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had\nobtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.\n\n27:14 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind,\ncalled Euroclydon.\n\n27:15 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the\nwind, we let her drive.\n\n27:16 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we\nhad much work to come by the boat: 27:17 Which when they had taken up,\nthey used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should\nfall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.\n\n27:18 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day\nthey lightened the ship; 27:19 And the third day we cast out with our\nown hands the tackling of the ship.\n\n27:20 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no\nsmall tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then\ntaken away.\n\n27:21 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them,\nand said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed\nfrom Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.\n\n27:22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no\nloss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.\n\n27:23 For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am,\nand whom I serve, 27:24 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought\nbefore Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with\nthee.\n\n27:25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it\nshall be even as it was told me.\n\n27:26 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.\n\n27:27 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and\ndown in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near\nto some country; 27:28 And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and\nwhen they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it\nfifteen fathoms.\n\n27:29 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast\nfour anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.\n\n27:30 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they\nhad let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would\nhave cast anchors out of the foreship, 27:31 Paul said to the\ncenturion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye\ncannot be saved.\n\n27:32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her\nfall off.\n\n27:33 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take\nmeat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and\ncontinued fasting, having taken nothing.\n\n27:34 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your\nhealth: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.\n\n27:35 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to\nGod in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to\neat.\n\n27:36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.\n\n27:37 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and\nsixteen souls.\n\n27:38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and\ncast out the wheat into the sea.\n\n27:39 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered\na certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it\nwere possible, to thrust in the ship.\n\n27:40 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed\nthemselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up\nthe mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.\n\n27:41 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship\naground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the\nhinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.\n\n27:42 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of\nthem should swim out, and escape.\n\n27:43 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their\npurpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast\nthemselves first into the sea, and get to land: 27:44 And the rest,\nsome on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship.\n\nAnd so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "28:1 And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was\ncalled Melita.\n\n28:2 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they\nkindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present\nrain, and because of the cold.\n\n28:3 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on\nthe fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his\nhand.\n\n28:4 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand,\nthey said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom,\nthough he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.\n\n28:5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.\n\n28:6 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down\ndead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no\nharm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a\ngod.\n\n28:7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the\nisland, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three\ndays courteously.\n\n28:8 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a\nfever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and\nlaid his hands on him, and healed him.\n\n28:9 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the\nisland, came, and were healed: 28:10 Who also honoured us with many\nhonours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were\nnecessary.\n\n28:11 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria,\nwhich had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.\n\n28:12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.\n\n28:13 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and\nafter one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to\nPuteoli: 28:14 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with\nthem seven days: and so we went toward Rome.\n\n28:15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to\nmeet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul\nsaw, he thanked God, and took courage.\n\n28:16 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners\nto the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself\nwith a soldier that kept him.\n\n28:17 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief\nof the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto\nthem, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the\npeople, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from\nJerusalem into the hands of the Romans.\n\n28:18 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because\nthere was no cause of death in me.\n\n28:19 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal\nunto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.\n\n28:20 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and\nto speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with\nthis chain.\n\n28:21 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of\nJudaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed\nor spake any harm of thee.\n\n28:22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as\nconcerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.\n\n28:23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him\ninto his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of\nGod, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses,\nand out of the prophets, from morning till evening.\n\n28:24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some\nbelieved not.\n\n28:25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after\nthat Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the\nprophet unto our fathers, 28:26 Saying, Go unto this people, and say,\nHearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall\nsee, and not perceive: 28:27 For the heart of this people is waxed\ngross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they\nclosed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their\nears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I\nshould heal them.\n\n28:28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is\nsent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.\n\n28:29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had\ngreat reasoning among themselves.\n\n28:30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and\nreceived all that came in unto him, 28:31 Preaching the kingdom of\nGod, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ,\nwith all confidence, no man forbidding him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

By what law? of works?\nNay: but by the law of faith.\n\n3:28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without\nthe deeds of the law.\n\n3:29 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles?\nYes, of the Gentiles also: 3:30 Seeing it is one God, which shall\njustify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.\n\n3:31 Do we then make void the law through faith?

Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.\n\n4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the\nrighteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that\nhe might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not\ncircumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: 4:12\nAnd the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision\nonly, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father\nAbraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.\n\n4:13 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not\nto Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the\nrighteousness of faith.\n\n4:14 For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,\nand the promise made of none effect: 4:15 Because the law worketh\nwrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.\n\n4:16 Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end\nthe promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is\nof the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is\nthe father of us all, 4:17 (As it is written, I have made thee a\nfather of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who\nquickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though\nthey were.\n\n4:18 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the\nfather of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall\nthy seed be.\n\n4:19 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now\ndead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness\nof Sarah's womb: 4:20 He staggered not at the promise of God through\nunbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; 4:21 And being\nfully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to\nperform.\n\n4:22 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.\n\n4:23 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to\nhim; 4:24 But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe\non him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; 4:25 Who was\ndelivered for our offences, and was raised again for our\njustification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?  12:18\nBut now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it\nhath pleased him.\n\n12:19 And if they were all one member, where were the body?  12:20 But\nnow are they many members, yet but one body.\n\n12:21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee:\nnor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.\n\n12:22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more\nfeeble, are necessary: 12:23 And those members of the body, which we\nthink to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant\nhonour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.\n\n12:24 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the\nbody together, having given more abundant honour to that part which\nlacked.\n\n12:25 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members\nshould have the same care one for another.\n\n12:26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it;\nor one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.\n\n12:27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.\n\n12:28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily\nprophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of\nhealings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.\n\n12:29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all\nworkers of miracles?  12:30 Have all the gifts of healing? do all\nspeak with tongues? do all interpret?  12:31 But covet earnestly the\nbest gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It is sown in\ncorruption; it is raised in incorruption: 15:43 It is sown in\ndishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised\nin power: 15:44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual\nbody. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.\n\n15:45 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul;\nthe last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\n\n15:46 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is\nnatural; and afterward that which is spiritual.\n\n15:47 The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the\nLord from heaven.\n\n15:48 As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is\nthe heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.\n\n15:49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear\nthe image of the heavenly.\n\n15:50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit\nthe kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\n\n15:51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we\nshall all be changed, 15:52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,\nat the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be\nraised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.\n\n15:53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal\nmust put on immortality.\n\n15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and\nthis mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to\npass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.\n\n15:55 O death, where is thy sting?

Did Titus make a\ngain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the\nsame steps?  12:19 Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you?\nwe speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved,\nfor your edifying.\n\n12:20 For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I\nwould, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest\nthere be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings,\nswellings, tumults: 12:21 And lest, when I come again, my God will\nhumble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned\nalready, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and\nlasciviousness which they have committed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with\nhim by the power of God toward you.\n\n13:5 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own\nselves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you,\nexcept ye be reprobates?  13:6 But I trust that ye shall know that we\nare not reprobates.\n\n13:7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear\napproved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as\nreprobates.\n\n13:8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.\n\n13:9 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this\nalso we wish, even your perfection.\n\n13:10 Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present\nI should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath\ngiven me to edification, and not to destruction.\n\n13:11 Finally, brethren, farewell.
